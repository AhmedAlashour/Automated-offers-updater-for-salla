# Automated-offers-updater-for-salla
A script to automatically update the following columns: offers price, end of offer date, label, and category.
Use case:
The script updates the columns mentioned above, with new columns in a sheet via the SKU code, meaning only products with the same SKU code will be updated. It will also append the category columns, eliminating the possibility of deleting or changing them. The script is compatible with salla's bulk product sheet.
